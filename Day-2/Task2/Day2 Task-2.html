        <h2 >Book Summary</h2>
        <p>The book exposes the changes in Indian society from independence in 1947 to the Emergency declared by Indian
            Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Mistry was generally critical of Indira Gandhi in the book. She, however, is
            never referred to by name by any of the characters, and is instead called simply "the Prime Minister". The
            characters, from diverse backgrounds, are brought together by economic forces changing India.</p>

        <p>A Fine Balance is the second novel by Rohinton Mistry, published by McClelland and Stewart in 1995. Set in
            "an unidentified city" in India, initially in 1975 and later in 1984 during the turmoil of The Emergency,[2]
            the book focuses on four characters from varied backgrounds Dina Dalal, Ishvar Darji, his nephew Omprakash
            Darji, and the young student Maneck Kohlah who come together and develop a bond.

            The novel won the 1995 Giller Prize.[3] It was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1996. It was one of the
            only two Canadian books selected for Oprah's Book Club, and was one of the selected books in the 2002
            edition of Canada Reads, championed by actress Megan Follows. In 2014, A Fine Balance was ranked in The
            Telegraph as one of the 10 all-time greatest Asian novels.[4] Emma-Lee Potter of The Independent listed it
            as the book with the strongest prose and character development out of 12 Indian novels "that everyone needs
